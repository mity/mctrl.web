2015-08-26 | Time to leave <a href="http://sf.net">SourceForge.net</a>. For the project web site, we are migrating to our own domain, <a href="http://mctrl.org">mctrl.org</a>. Please update your bookmarks. For some time, our code already lives elsewhere, on <a href="https://github.org/mity/mctrl">GitHub</a>.
2015-08-26 | Thanks to <a href="http://appveyor.com">appveyor.com</a>, mCtrl project is now continually integrated. Any commit/pull into the upstream repo triggers an automatic build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013. See <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mity/mctrl/branch/master">the latest build results</a>.

2013-03-12 | What a busy week. I experienced hard disk failure, so spent a lot of time to save some data, reinstalling Windows and all the SW on new disk. A lot of fun was also caused by the idea to register mCtrl as a project for <a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Scan</a>. False positive rate is quite low and acceptable and it indeed found so many bugs, some of them quite major. Static analysis capabilities of the tool really impressed me. Thank you, Coverity!
2013-03-03 | Minor update 0.9.1 comes. The coolest news of this release is animation of MdiTab and expand controls, but of course there is more. See <a href="changelog.php">ChangeLog</a> for more info.
2013-02-06 | New version 0.9.0 brings many new features, including new chart control, expand control and tree-list view control. Note that it also breaks binary  compatibility with older versions. However I consider it as a major step towards 1.0 and API freeze. See <a href="changelog.php">ChangeLog</a> for more complete list of changes.
