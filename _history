2013-03-12 | What a busy week. I experienced hard disk failure, so spent a lot of time to save some data, reinstalling Windows and all the SW on new disk. A lot of fun was also caused by the idea to register mCtrl as a project for <a href="http://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity Scan</a>. False positive rate is quite low and acceptable and it indeed found so many bugs, some of them quite major. Static analysis capabilities of the tool really impressed me. Thank you, Coverity!
2013-03-03 | Minor update 0.9.1 comes. The coolest news of this release is animation of MdiTab and expand controls, but of course there is more. See <a href="changelog.php">ChangeLog</a> for more info.
2013-02-06 | New version 0.9.0 brings many new features, including new chart control, expand control and tree-list view control. Note that it also breaks binary  compatibility with older versions.
