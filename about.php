<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>mCtrl is C library providing set of additional user interface controls
for Windows, intended to be complementary to standard Win32API controls from
<tt>USER32.DLL</tt> and <tt>COMCTL32.DLL</tt>.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="gallery.php">Gallery</a> to see brief overview of provided
controls.</p>

<h2>Basic Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><span class=hinline>Supported systems:</span> Windows 2000 and newer
            (both 32bit and 64bit).</li>
    <li><span class=hinline>API:</span> Based on windows messages, in a manner
            similar to the API of <tt>USER32.DLL</tt> and <tt>COMCTL32.DLL</tt>.
    <li><span class=hinline>Unicode:</span> Internally all strings are Unicode.
            The interface mimics the Win32API duality controled with the
            preprocessor macro <tt>UNICODE</tt>.</li>
    <li><span class=hinline>Consistency:</span> The controls keep consistent
            look and feel with the system, including support for XP theming
            aka <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773187%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
            visual styles</a>.</li>
</ul>
